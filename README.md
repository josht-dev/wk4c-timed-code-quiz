# wk4c-timed-code-quiz

## Description

This is a timed quiz of JavaScript question for users to compete with their coding knowledge. 

I successfully used an interval timer and generated the questions, answers, and high scores dynamically from JavaScript via the DOM API. High scores are stored and retrieved from the users local storage.

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

To use the timed quiz, click the start button to begin. Clicking on an answer chip will choose that answer. Incorrect answers will subtract 5 seconds from their time while correct answers will add 5 to their score. Any left over time will also be added to their score.

The player will be prompted to enter their initials while displaying their score. They will be taken to the high score screen which will display the top 10 high scores. From there they can clear the high scores or try again. 

The High Scores button at the beginning will also display a list of the top 10 high scores.
